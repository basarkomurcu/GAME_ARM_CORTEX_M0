# GAME_ARM_CORTEX_M0
  The aim of the Project is to implement a game using ARM CORTEX M0 instruction set on KEIL simulator. Project includes LCD peripheral. To make use of the LCD, you must add required DLL iles manually to the Keil_v5/ARM/BIN folder. DLL files are provided in the repository.

  The goal of the game is to reaching the top-side of the screen without getting hit by the bricks that are moving horizontally. If you get hit by the brick you get pinned the location where you were born initially. If you successfully reach the top-side of the screen, you win the game and get spawned at the initial position.
 Here is a snapshot of the game:
